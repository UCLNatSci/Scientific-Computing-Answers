{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3657c4","input":"### Part 1\n\nFollow the steps in the notes to determine the (x, y) co-ordinates of the bead in the image `particle/frame0.png`.\n1. Use `np.imread` to convert the image file to a numpy array.\n1. Convert the image to greyscale by summing along the final axis.\n1. Threshold the array. Determine a value for the threshold which results in just a single 'blob'.\n1. Determine the location using the function `sn.center_of_mass` (you do not need to determine the largest blob since there should be only one!)\n1.
